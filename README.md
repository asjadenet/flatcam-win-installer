# flatcam-win-installer
Automatic setup script for installing latest FlatCAM Beta 8.995

## Description

I had trouble installing the latest beta software of FlatCAM. I made a script that does this tedious job itself.

## Installation

Clone the repository like this:

	git clone https://github.com/asjadenet/flatcam-win-installer.git

or download the PowerShell script files one by one and save them to the location C:\flatcam-win-installer.

Open PowerShell as an administrator.

	cd C:\flatcam-win-installer
	.\setup-flatcam.ps1
	
Enjoy!
